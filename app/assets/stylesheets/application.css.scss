/*
 * We don't depend on Sprockets, we load everything by @importing via Sass.
 * (See this note about Sprockets & Sass: https://github.com/rails/sass-rails#important-note)
 *
 * This allows us to include all the variables and mixins in one place and have them accessible anywhere,
 * in addition to controlling the load order. The downside of this approach is that we must remember to
 * @import new CSS files here rather than relying on them to be loaded automatically.
 *
 * The second downside is that there's an extra step to debugging, since you must look in the generated
 * application.css file to see the original file and line number. This isn't so bad since you can click
 * line numbers in both WebKit Developer Tools & Firebug and it takes you straight to the line that
 * tells you the original file and line number.
